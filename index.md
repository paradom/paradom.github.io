I am a Physics and Mathematics student at Oregon State University with interest
in computation.

I have been a undergraduate employee at [CQLS](https://cqls.oregonstate.edu/) for the past 2 years, where I have been
able to explore my interests in machine learning and data science on a variety of [projects](/research/).
